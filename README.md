# Creating Dataset with Jupyter Notebook

To get started, follow these steps to create the dataset using the `create_dataset` Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code:**
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `create_dataset.ipynb` notebook.
   - Open the notebook using the built-in Jupyter extension.

2. **Execute Notebook Cells:**
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute each cell.
   - The notebook will process the MIDI files in the "Songs" folder and create a PyTorch dataset.

# TODO:

## Train a Deep Learning Model:

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, e.g., PyTorch, numpy, etc.

2. **Load Dataset:**
   - Use the PyTorch dataset created in the previous step.

3. **Define Model:**
   - Implement your deep learning model. Define layers, activation functions, and any other necessary components.

4. **Train Model:**
   - Train your model using the created PyTorch dataset. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

## Validate the Model:

1. **Validation Dataset:**
   - Prepare a separate validation dataset or split the existing dataset.

2. **Evaluate Model:**
   - Use the validation dataset to evaluate the model's performance.
   - Analyze metrics such as accuracy, loss, etc.

3. **Adjust and Iterate:**
   - Based on the validation results, make adjustments to your model or training process.
   - Iterate until you achieve satisfactory performance.
